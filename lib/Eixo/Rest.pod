=head1 NAME

Eixo::Rest - Base modules to build REST api clients

=head1 SINOPSIS

Build an api client:

- Define the api products

    package MyApiClient;

    use strict;
    use parent qw(Eixo::Rest::Api);

    sub users {
        $_[0]->produce('MyApi::User');
    }

    sub images {
        $_[0]->produce('MyApi::Image');
    }


- Implement api products 

    package MyApi::User;

    use parent qw(Eixo::Rest::Product);

    sub getUsers {

        my ($self,%args) = @_;

        my $list  = [];

        my $args = {
            all => $args{all} || undef,
            limit => $args{limit} || 1000,
        };

        
        $self->api->getUsers(

            args => $args, 

            get_params => [qw(all limit)],

            __callback => sub {

                foreach my $r (@{$_[0]}){

                    push @$list, MyApi::User->new(%$r)
                }

                return $list;
            }
        );

    }

- Use it:

    my $a = MyApiClient->new(http://api.acme.com);

    my $user_list = $a->getUsers(
        all => 1, 
        limit => 10
    );

- Use it asynchronously:


    my $a = MyApiClient->new(http://api.acme.com);

    my $job = $a->getUsersAsync(
        all => 1, 
        limit => 10
    );

    # do other stuff
    ...

    # when you want the results
    my $user_list = $a->wait_for_job($job);
